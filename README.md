# Deep-Learning-Neural-Networks-with-Keras

## A. Build a baseline model
Use the Keras library to build a neural network with the following:
     - One hidden layer of 10 nodes, and a ReLU activation function
     - Use the adam optimizer and the mean squared error as the loss function.

     1. Randomly split the data into a training and test sets by 
     holding 30% of the data for testing. You can use the 
     train_test_splithelper function from Scikit-learn.
     
     2. Train the model on the training data using 50 epochs.
     
     3. Evaluate the model on the test data and compute the 
     mean squared error between the predicted concrete strength 
     and the actual concrete strength. You can use the 
     mean_squared_error function from Scikit-learn.
     
     4. Repeat steps 1 - 3, 50 times, i.e., create a list of 50 mean squared errors.
     
     5. Report the mean and the standard deviation of the mean squared errors.

## B. Normalize the data
Repeat Part A but use a normalized version of the data. 
Recall that one way to normalize the data is by subtracting 
the mean from the individual predictors and dividing by the standard deviation.

## C. Increase the number of epochs
Repeat Part B but use 100 epochs this time for training.
